Mother Earth	Jan 1986	Prime Wardens (Vol. 1?) #1	The ancient earth-spirit Akash'Bhuta has bested her continual foe. With this latest Virtuoso of the Void defeated, nothing can possibly stand in her way -- humanity shall finally be laid low! The Argent Adept is rescued by Fanatic, and they are joined by Captain Cosmic and Tempest. They travel to the time-lost island of Insula Primalis, where they find Haka already locked in combat with Void-altered dinosaurs. And with that, the new team known as the Prime Wardens is complete. The heroes descend into the heart of the island to face the spirit of the earth itself...	1	Akash'Bhuta	Heart of the Island	After an Environment card is destroyed, Akash'Bhuta deals each target 2 fire damage.	The Prime Wardens fought their way through the heart of Insula Primalis to separate Akash'Bhuta from that ancient island's power. The Argent Adept had to enter the Void and face her essence alone. He was barely able to survive and sever Akash'Bhuta's connection, but succeed he did. And just in time! The Freedom Five arrived to join forces against the formidable earth spirit. Even still, all would have been lost if not for the timely intervention of a shadowy gunman who seemed to appear from nowhere, take the precisely necessary shot, and disappear without a word. With his aid, the heroes were able to defeat Akash'Bhuta and save the day!

To Hunt a Hero	Apr 1988	The Savage Haka #1	A dangerous new villain has appeared: Ambuscade, the super-human big game hunter! He is always looking for a greater challenge, for more prestige! What could be more glorious than defeating the powerful Haka himself? Ambuscade has quite the flair for the dramatic. His ambush tactics, invisibility tech, and dangerous devices begin to aggravate even Haka. Will the biggest game hunter take down the biggest hero?	1	Ambuscade	Only Takes One	After Ambuscade's character card flips to the "Hunter of the Mighty" side, Ambuscade deals the Hero character with the lowest HP (H) melee damage. If any Hero is ever incapacitated, Ambuscade has successfully completed his hunt. Game Over.	Against all odds, Ambuscade seemed to get the better of Haka at every turn! At least, until Haka actually managed to get his hands on his slippery assailant. Once the fight came down to drawn out hand-to-hand combat, Ambuscades's fancy moves and clever ploys could only carry him so far. Ambuscade may be the flashier combatant, but Haka's age, experience, and seemingly inexhaustible strength allowed the Maori warrior to outlast Ambuscade. Haka survived all of Ambuscade's traps and ultimately defeated him, but with his failsafe invisibility, Ambuscade was able to slip away at the end. To be certain, he was most disappointed by this failure... but not to fear! Ambuscade will return! He's gotten a taste of the deadliest game and will not be satisfied with anything less!

Throne to the Wolves	Apr 2010	Alpha: The Wolf-Woman #19	Apex the Wolf-King's terrifying pack has grown greatly, with many former pack alphas aligning their werewolf forces under Apex's banner. However, with that notoriety comes a deadly price. The throne of the Wolf-King is held by whichever werewolf is recognized as the mightiest, and the former pack alphas that have pledged their allegiance to Apex are all too ready to take his power for themselves if Apex shows even the slightest hint of weakness...	2	Apex	Leader of the Pack	When Apex would be destroyed, if there are any other Villain Werewolf cards in play, destroy the non-character Werewolf card with the lowest HP instead. After a card is destroyed this way, Apex regains 10 HP.	Over the course of the conflict, Apex was pleased to see Alpha lose herself in the fight. She tore through the ranks of his werewolf army, only proving further to the Wolf-King that she was far more of a true werewolf than anyone assumed. Attempting to regain control of the situation, NightMist performed a dark ritual to suppress the moon itself, forcing each werewolf into human form. Alpha returned to her senses, horrified at having let the wolf within have so much control over her. In a cliffhanger ending, Alpha is revealed by Apex to be a natural-born werewolf, not a person cursed as everyone had assumed. Faced with this horrific realization, she was unprepared for the further reveal that Apex is, in fact, the sire of Alpha's father.

The Deceiver	Nov 1980	Absolution #7	Fanatic's unshakable faith and righteous purpose have been challenged as never before. Apostate, a figure of dark power and charisma, arrives claiming to be her creator -- a fallen angel who molded her from lies and stolen fragments of divinity. His arrival tears at the very  foundation of Fanatic's identity, calling into question her divine mission and her place in the grand design. Apostate doesn't simply attack her with swords or summoned demons; he strikes at her mind and heart. Every word he speaks, every action he takes, is designed to unravel her conviction, casting doubt on everything she believes. As Fanatic grapples with these revelations, her faith begins to falter, and the Angel of Vengeance is brought low. The rise of Apostate signals the greatest threat Fanatic has ever faced -- not just to her life, but to her very soul.	2	Apostate	Infernal Fodder	After a Villain Demon card is destroyed, put it under the Villain character card.	The battle between Fanatic and Apostate raged across physical and spiritual planes, with the fallen angel's taunts and illusions shaking her resolve. Apostate's minions swarmed the field, forcing Fanatic and her allies to fight for every inch of ground. The tide of darkness pressed in, and Fanatic's own doubts threatened to break her. In the chaos, her allies' support became a lifeline, reigniting the faith she had nearly lost. In a climactic clash, she rose above Apostate's manipulations, wielding her holy blade with renewed purpose. As her allies held back the demonic hordes, she seized a crucial moment to sever Apostate's link to his corrupted relics. Though Apostate escaped, his defeat was clear, his power diminished by Fanatic's rekindled faith and her allies' unyielding determination. Fanatic emerged stronger but tempered, her mission now guided not just by divine wrath, but by a deeper understanding of the strength found in unity and self-awareness.	*Absolution* #7-10	Absolution #10	Clarity	When the path forward is unclear, look inward.

Moonfall	Apr 1968	Moonfall #1	The dastardly Baron Blade has a world-ending plan to destroy his nemesis Legacy once and for all! If the Freedom Five don't stop him in time, his terrible plot will spell doom for humanity. The revenge-fueled Baron set up his TerraLunar Impulsion Beam in the long abandoned ruins of Atlantis, hoping that after the pyrrhic victory of pulling the moon into the earth, he and his forces will emerge to rule what's left. The heroes must find their way through the twisting ruins to destroy the mad baron's doomsday device before it's too late!	0	Baron Blade	My Life for Mordengrad!	Whenever Baron Blade would be dealt damage, reveal the top card of the Villain deck. If it is a Minion card, play it and redirect the damage to that Minion card. Otherwise, bury the revealed card.	The Freedom Five destroy the TerraLunar Impulsion Beam! The Baron puts on his power suit and joins the fight himself! However, the heroes prove too much for the mad inventor. His suit explodes, taking out a wall. The rush of water floods the Baron out, never to be seen again... Mere days later, Baron Blade assaults Megalopolis. Clad once again in his power suit, Baron Blade goes toe-to-toe with Legacy. The battle armor is repaired but not entirely fixed from the end of the Moonfall event. As a result, during the fight, when Legacy punches a sparking panel on Blade's back, the entire suit explodes. Baron Blade is presumed dead. He couldn't have escaped again, surely.

Wayward Sun	May 1987	Freedom Five #445	The Freedom Five have picked up a strange transmission that seems to have come from beyond the stars! Some piece of alien technology has made its way through the planet's atmosphere and is transmitting a distress signal as it plummets towards the Earth. Could this be some alien in need of aid, or might it be a trap left over from the recent Thorathian invasion? Heroes including the Freedom Five and their new ally Expatriette head to Insula Primalis to investigate, though they know that Citizen Dawn controls that island. She and her hordes of Citizens will oppose the heroes at every turn.	1	Citizen Dawn	Alien Influence	Citizen cards are immune to any type of damage that their game text says they deal.	Before this event, the Citizens of the Sun were a mostly faceless group of powerful minions for Citizen Dawn, other than a couple notable exceptions. However, with the alien artifact empowering the Citizens, they each took on new aspects of power, making them greater threats and paving the way for later events featuring the Citizens of the Sun. After the artifact was unearthed by the Citizens, it hovered around the island, avoiding capture and monitoring the fight between costumed heroes and super-powered extremists. Eventually, it apparently had observed enough of the conflict, and the mysterious artifact flew away, having left its mark on the Citizens of the Sun and their home.	Freedom Five #445-#447	Freedom Five #447	Power to the Powerless	Citizen Dawn only cares about superpowered people. All others are insignificant insects in her eyes, even her powerless daughter. As Expatriette joins the ranks of the heroes, Citizen Dawn might learn to not ignore her unpowered foes.	1 Hero discovers 2 Item cards.	Dark Twistings	Citizen Dawn was defeated with the help of an ally who seems perhaps not so heroic. "I'm only here to help," the Visionary insists, with a sinister smile.	1 Hero uses 1 power. If that power deals damage, +3 to that damage, and change that damage to a type of your choice. Then, that hero discards 1 card.	Core Game
The Fabric of Despair	Oct 1973	Fabric of Despair #1	The Cult of Gloom has existed for centuries, but always deeply hidden away behind secrets and whispers. Now, a new leader of the cult has emerged -- Andrew Massey -- a charismatic warlock with more talent for twisting the hearts and minds of man than any aspect of the arcane arts. Cult Leader Massey has brought many new cultists into the fold, working with other powerful Chosen of Gloom to perform a dread ritual. The Chosen seek to bring together eldritch relics of Gloom to summon their terrible lord and master into this world. Who can stand in the way of this more organized Cult of Gloom?!	1	GloomWeaver	True Believers	END PHASE Discover 1 Chosen card. Each Chosen card regains (H) HP.	The Cult of Gloom had never been so organized before, but even still, they were unable to bring their dread lord and master into this world. The cursed master of magic known as NightMist undid the rituals that Massey and his allies constructed, trapping many of the cultists in the Realm of Discord with GloomWeaver, rather than letting the demon god through. This was no victory for the mortal realm, however. The anguish felt by the Cult of Gloom only further fed GloomWeaver himself -- bringing more gloom into the world was all he wanted, after all. The cult still has more focus and leadership than ever before, and the most powerful among them know that death is not the end. Servitude to GloomWeaver is eternal.	Fabric of Despair #1-#5 Tome of the Bizarre Vol. 2 #182-#183	Tome of the Bizarre (Vol. 2?) #183	The Fang of Taranerach	Among the relics of the Cult of Gloom is a most curious knife that radiates power and cuts through any barrier.

Invasion of Earth	Dec 1986	Freedom Five #440	In one of the biggest Sentinel Comics events of all time, Grand Warlord Voss's Thorathian Conquering Fleet appears in our solar system and begins its assault on planet Earth! The Grand Warlord's troops set up a temporary base on Mars, from which they are able to launch nigh-endless waves of Gene-Bound minions to Earth, using quark-drive translocation technology. Meanwhile, Voss and his Thorathian commanders take the fight to the heroes themselves, taking down some of the mightiest heroes early on in an attempt to deprive the planet of its defenders...	2	Grand Warlord Voss	Warlord's Tactics	If there are no Gene-Bound cards in play, +1 damage dealt by Villain cards. If there are any Gene-Bound cards in play, -1 damage dealt to Thorathian cards.	Voss's invasion almost ended humanity. Legacy was knocked out early on and the heroes were disheartened and in disarray. But when Felicia, Legacy's daughter, joined the fight wearing a Legacy costume, she provided much needed inspiration. The Prime Wardens joined the fight on Mars, destroying the gene-binding facilities and translocators. They then returned to Earth... all except for Tempest. Instead, he attacked Voss, not content with routing the Thorathian forces. Tempest and Voss ultimately fought in the Realm of Discord, but only Tempest emerged alive.

Teller of Tales	Oct 1976	Tome of the Bizarre Vol. 2 #214	In the shadowy pages of Tome of the Bizarre, the enigmatic narrator of countless strange tales, Grimm, is revealed to be more than a simple storyteller. Grimm is an ancient, otherworldly entity, pulling the strings behind the scenes of its stories for decades But the shocking truth emerges: the tales in Tome of the Bizarre are not mere fiction. Grimm has been forcing people -- heroes and innocents alike -- into the roles of these twisted tales, trapping them in its dark, eternal theater of fate. When the heroes uncover Grimm's sinister influence, they are drawn into its latest narrative, each cast into archetypal roles in a horrifying drama. Reality twists and bends as they struggle to maintain their identities and break free from the parts Grimm has written for them. Can they escape, or are their fates sealed by Grimm's quill?	2	Grimm	All the World's a Stage	END PHASE  Reveal the top card of the Environment deck. If the revealed card is a target or a One-Shot card, play it. Otherwise, add 1 token to each Role card in the Villain play area, then discard the revealed card.	As the heroes fought through the horrors of Grimm's tale, they realized the story itself was their prison. Every action played into Grimm's narrative, pushing them toward fatal conclusions. However, through determination and ingenuity, the heroes exploited a loophole in Grimm's storytelling: it could not control improvisation. By acting against type and defying their forced roles, the heroes destabilized Grimm's plot. As the tale collapsed, they confronted Grimm directly, their willpower burning through its manipulations. Grimm retreated into the shadows, its essence scattering but not destroyed. Freed from the story, the heroes faced unsettling questions: What did Grimm gain from these tales? And what would happen when he inevitably returned with a new one? For now, they had escaped, but Grimm's influence was far from over.	*Tome of the Bizarre* Vol. 2 #214-215	Tome of the Bizarre Vol. 2 #215	Grimm Ex Machina	Suddenly, a cloaked figure appeared, bearing a gift…	1 Hero character deals themselves 2 fixed psychic damage.

The Final Legacy	May 1990	The Final Legacy #1	The tyrannical Iron Legacy had already crushed the heroes of his own reality, his brutal regime enforcing absolute order. But his thirst for control could not be contained. Using his immense power, Iron Legacy tore through the fabric of the Multiverse, invading other realities to spread his reign of terror. In these new worlds, his arrival was unstoppable -- a herald of destruction cloaked in iron, turning heroes into hunted fugitives and leaving devastation in his wake. The surviving heroes of these invaded realities banded together, desperate to defend their worlds. But Iron Legacy was a force unlike any other, a tragic mirror of the hero they once admired. With the Multiverse itself at risk of falling under his iron fist, these heroes faced an impossible challenge: could they stop a man who had already defeated his greatest enemies -- his own friends?	1	Iron Legacy	Freedom's End	After a Villain Ongoing card is buried or destroyed, Iron Legacy regains ? minus 2 HP.	In a desperate battle, the heroes lured Iron Legacy into a trap, using his own power against him. Pushed to their limits, they faced the grim truth: this version of Legacy was a fallen symbol of hope. The Wraith devised a risky plan to exploit his greatest weakness: his love for his daughter. The heroes projected a hologram of Felicia Parsons, breaking his resolve and forcing him to confront the pain and rage consuming him. In his moment of hesitation, the heroes struck, banishing him back to his reality. This battle left the heroes with an uneasy question: if one Legacy could fall so far, could it happen to others? The Multiverse had won the day, but the threat of Iron Legacy was far from over.	*America's Finest Legacy* #201-202, *The Fall of Legacy* One-Shot, *The Final Legacy* #1-6, *Freedom Six* One-Shot	Freedom Six One-Shot	The Worst Timeline	Get back up.

Run of Luck	Nov 1997	Run of Luck #1	Highbrow is one of those classic "criminal mastermind who doesn't want to do the hard work themselves" types. She hatches clever plans, pulls together a specific team of ne'er-do-wells, and watches the whole thing unfold from the safety of a secure and luxurious location. Normally, Kismet isn't into that kind of thing, but in this case, she's been hired to stand around a casino and make things go well for her crew and poorly for the heroes. That's the kind of work Kismet can get behind.	1	Kismet	Fortune's Blessing	After a Lucky card is played, discard the top card of 1 Hero deck. If the discarded card has any keywords that match any keywords on the played Lucky card, play the top card of the Villain deck.	Things have not been going well for Pete Riske. He ran into an old girlfriend at a casino. Turns out, that old girlfriend is the villain Kismet. And she's still holding a grudge after all these years. And she has probability controlling powers that make everyone around her unlucky. In the last hour, Setback fell into a giant fish tank, broke his arm, tripped over his own shoelaces, and accidentally ate food that was very expired. He'd certainly felt better. Just when Setback felt like giving up on handling his luck curse, things fell into place. It must be connected to Kismet! He apologized to her for how things went before -- they both deserved better.

Administrative Assassin	Feb 2005	Administrative Assassin #1	The heroes face their most confounding threat yet. A shadowy adversary, known only as Miss Information, has orchestrated a relentless series of attacks on the Freedom Five -- equipment malfunctions, false leads, and devastating ambushes that always seem one step ahead of the heroes. Despite their best efforts, the team could not uncover her identity or predict her next move. The strain began to show, with the heroes questioning their own decisions and even each other. Every attempt to outmaneuver her failed, leaving the Freedom Five feeling powerless against a foe they couldn't see. As the situation grew increasingly dire, it became clear: this enemy wasn't just dismantling their mission -- she was tearing apart the very foundation of their trust.	2	Miss Information	Red Herrings	After a Clue card is destroyed, the ? minus 2 Hero targets with the highest HP deal themselves 1 fixed psychic damage each.	When all seemed lost, Parse stepped in to unravel the mystery. Her analytical precision led to the shocking revelation: Miss Information was none other than Aminia Twain, the team's trusted secretary, who had been sabotaging them from within. The confrontation at Pike Industrial Complex was a heart-wrenching battle -- not just against Miss Information's traps, but against the emotional devastation of betrayal. In the end, Parse's quick thinking and the team's resilience brought an end to Aminia's schemes. However, the victory came at a cost. The Freedom Five were left shaken, knowing their closest ally had become such a terrible foe.

Atrophy Case	Jan 1997	Atrophy Case #1	A creeping sickness spread through the natural world. Forests rotted overnight, rivers stagnated, and animals wasted away without explanation. The ecosystems The Naturalist fought to protect were succumbing to a rot that devoured life itself. Determined to investigate, he followed the trail of devastation to its source. At the heart of the corruption stood Necrosis, a grotesque being of living decay. His presence spread rot, poisoning water, turning forests to ash, and thickening the air with death. Necrosis, a manifestation of entropy, reveled in destruction and mocked The Naturalist's efforts, declaring decay eternal and unstoppable. As the blight spread faster than he could contain, The Naturalist questioned if his efforts would be enough. Necrosis fed on despair, his corruption accelerating as hope waned. Summoning all his strength, The Naturalist prepared to face this walking apocalypse, knowing that failure could mean nature's collapse.	2	Necrosis	Volatile Decay	END PHASE  Add 2 tokens to each Hero character card with 2 or more tokens. Remove 1 token from each Hero character card with only 1 token.	The Naturalist could not face Necrosis alone. Heroes rallied to his side, each bringing unique skills to fight the spreading blight. They fought desperately, but every clash only fed Necrosis's power. His touch corrupted all it reached -- the battlefield became a wasteland of rot and despair. Necrosis's cruelty extended beyond the fight, targeting The Naturalist's civilian allies. Seeing those he sought to protect turned into instruments of destruction forced The Naturalist to confront the fragility of his mission. Driven by grief and fury, The Naturalist charged Necrosis directly. The villain, once a brilliant scientist, now stood as a grotesque symbol of decay. Grappling with Necrosis's overwhelming power and tragedy, The Naturalist delivered a decisive blow, forcing Necrosis to flee or be destroyed. Though victorious, the heroes knew the corruption lingered. Necrosis's chilling parting words echoed: "Decay is eternal.

Singularity	Apr 1976	Singularity #1	Omnitron in a massive robotic form attacks the Eastern seaboard, leading to a conflict in Megalopolis with the Freedom Five. The heroes mobilize and protect the city, and even seem successful in destroying the rampaging robot... but their victory is short-lived. Omnitron isn't a pile of metal parts -- it's the code, and that code has started infecting all electronics it encounters. Now that Omnitron conflicts are occurring everywhere, the heroes must scramble to deal with this incursion on many fronts, knowing that the only way to truly win is to isolate all of the Omnitron code before it can assimilate everything!	1	Omnitron	Pervasive Omnicode	Each Item card gains the keyword "Device", has 6 HP, and gains the following game text: END PHASE This card deals each non-Device Hero target 1 lightning damage.	At every turn, Omnitron was ahead of the heroes. Haka rampaged through a crowd of robot drones, destroying them by the handful, but he was still surrounded. Ra brought forth his hottest flames, only to watch Omnitron's frame become immune to extreme temperatures. It wasn't until the heroes were unexpectedly aided by a time-traveling robot that the conflict changed. This future version of Omnitron called itself "Omnitron-X". It was here to correct its past wrongs, and it paid the ultimate price to do so. When Omnitron attempted to overpower the Omnitron-X code, the robot from the future corrupted the Omnitron programming, ending its endless assimilation. The robot menace was no more.

Those who live on the street level know the rumors have too much truth in them to be casually disregarded. The mix of toxic sludge, chemical testing remnants, growth hormones, and illicit drugs streaming from the Pike Industrial Complex has mutated someone -- or something -- in the sewers. Now, the Plague Rat hungers, and he knows where to find his next meal...	1	Plague Rat	Rapid Infection	After Plague Rat's Villain character card flips, discover 1 Ongoing card.	While the Wraith attempted to keep the peace and patrol the streets of Rook City, less publicly-known heroes Mister Fixer and Expatriette teamed up to deal directly with the mutated rodent threat, knowing that if they couldn't clean out the Rook City sewers, many lives would be in grave danger. They armed themselves and descended into the lair of filth and disease. Tracking the monster, they located Plague Rat's nest and found a number of infected civilians there. The heroes extracted the civilians, destroyed the nest, and -- after a dangerous fight in the dark with Plague Rat -- managed to escape with their lives. Though ultimately unsuccessful in getting rid of Plague Rat entirely, they were still able to drive it deeper into the sewers and make it think twice about preying on the people above.

Prelude of the Soulless	Aug 1983	Prelude of the Soulless One-Shot	The life-draining and life-ending Spite was one of the worst villains to stalk the streets of Rook City. Even the bravest of street-toughs feared him, avoiding the alleys and underpasses he was rumored to frequent. Of course, no one knew just where Spite might strike next, and most of the reports about him hung on mere shreds of fact. His powers grew with every kill as he prepared to take on the one hero who he blamed for making him the monster he became.	1	Spite	Evil Smile	After a Villain Ongoing card is destroyed, Spite deals the target other than himself with the lowest HP 2 infernal damage.	The Wraith thought she had finally caught Spite unawares, but he'd been waiting for her, and he had a hostage. The killer and the hero stared at each other, her with eyes filled with malice, him with eyes of mirth. "What are you going to do, hero? I hold her life in my hands. If you so much as twitch, I'll kill her -- it'll be all your fault. Are you ready for even more blood on your h-" Spite's words were cut off by a harsh gurgle as a wooden arrow suddenly sprouted from the middle of his forehead. As the Wraith turned to look for who fired the shot, Spite fell to the ground, unquestionably dead. The Wraith and the newcomer Parse weren't likely to see eye-to-eye on this, but at least Spite was gone and would never be a problem again.

Terrorform Mark II	Apr 2004	Tome of the Bizarre (Vol. 3?) #193	Based on RevoCorp's secret Terrorform project, this new Terrorform Mark II is equipped with reactive shielding to keep the heroes from so easily breaching the towering form. After-action reports from the first Terrorform indicated that it performed as intended, but with additional time in the field, it could have increased its scope and yield by at least 20%. With this run, Terrorform should be able to ramp up notable collaterals.	2	Terrorform	Mark II	After a card is put under the Villain character card, Terrorform deals each Hero target 2 lightning damage. If Terrorform has 50 or fewer HP, +1 damage dealt by Terrorform.	The first time a Terrorform attacked, the resulting battle almost entirely destroyed a national park. It was only due to the generosity of the company RevoCorp that the park was able to be saved and maintained, and the oil and mineral rights claimed by RevoCorp as part of the relief efforts seemed only fair. However, when the second Terrorform was defeated, there was comparatively little damage to the landscape and natural world. The heroes who arrived on the scene to stop this metal monstrosity seemed more in tune with nature and even magic. The Naturalist and Akash'Thriya headed up the offensive, with aid from the Argent Adept, Haka, and the Scholar. Whoever is behind these Terrorforms will hopefully be dissuaded from launching another one.

Nightmare World	Jul 1990	Nightmare World #1	This reality's six-year-old Vanessa Long fell into an unexplainable coma -- but what seemed like a medical mystery turned into a nightmare made real. Her unconscious mind unleashed horrifying psychic projections into reality, wreaking havoc on the world. Monsters, shadows, and alien horrors emerged from her dreams, tearing through city streets and vanishing only when defeated. Heroes scrambled to combat the threats, unaware of their true nature. The Visionary, sensing a familiar psychic signature, uncovered the truth: Vanessa's nightmares were not just dreams -- they were manifestations of immense latent power. As the projections grew stronger and more destructive, The Visionary and the heroes raced against time to protect the world and save the innocent child at the heart of the chaos.	1	The Dreamer	Sleepwalking	END PHASE  The Dreamer deals the non-Villain target with the highest HP 2 melee damage. That target deals The Dreamer 1 fixed melee damage.	With Vanessa's fate and reality hanging by a thread, the heroes waged a desperate battle against nightmare projections. Meanwhile, The Visionary plunged into Vanessa's fractured mind, navigating a psychic battlefield of fear and despair. Every second counted as the nightmares threatened to overwhelm the heroes, and a terrible question loomed: could they save the child without destroying her? In a surge of willpower and empathy, The Visionary reached Vanessa's core, quieting her fears and guiding her back to consciousness. The nightmare entities evaporated, leaving behind shattered streets and shaken heroes. Vanessa was safe -- but The Visionary knew her powers were destined to fully awaken. The victory was bittersweet; this was only the beginning of Vanessa Long's story.	*Nightmare World* #1-6, *Mind Over Matter* #32-38, *Justice Comics* #422, *Mystery Comics* Vol. 2 #203, *Prime Wardens* Vol. 1 #55, *Tome of the Bizarre* Vol. 3 #125, *America's Finest Legacy* #224, *Freedom Five* #485	Nightmare World #6	High Mountain Flowing Water	A grandmother's soothing voice.

War of Heliopolis	Dec 1995	War of Heliopolis #1	An ancient power has awakened as The Ennead -- nine mortals imbued with the might of Egyptian gods -- emerged from centuries of slumber. They sought to reclaim dominion over a modern world that had long forgotten them, unleashing arcane devastation across the globe. Cities fell, the skies burned, and the earth trembled under their godlike wrath. Ra, the modern embodiment of the sun god, stood as humanity's only defense against these resurrected deities. But even his fiery power faltered before The Ennead's collective strength. As their influence spread, the stakes became clear: the world faced annihilation unless Ra and his allies could stop them. The Ennead had returned, and their ancient ambition threatened the balance of life itself.	2	The Ennead	The Great Pesedjet	START PHASE  If there are fewer than ? Villain targets in play, shuffle the Villain trash into the Villain deck, then discover ? Relic cards. END PHASE  If there are any cards under the Villain character card, (flip) the Villain character card. Otherwise, play the top card of the Villain deck.	Ra was joined by other heroes -- most notably the avenging angel Fanatic -- and fought valiantly against The Ennead's overwhelming power. Despite their combined might, Ra suffered a grievous defeat, leaving humanity's last hope in tatters. But Ra refused to succumb. In a moment of profound transformation, he embraced his destiny, rising anew as the Horus of Two Horizons. Reborn with divine strength, Ra challenged The Ennead one last time in a cataclysmic battle. He shattered their unity, dispersing their essence and breaking their hold over the world. Though victorious, Ra's sacrifice left him forever changed. The Ennead's defeat marked the end of their reign, but the scars they left behind served as a somber reminder of the dangers of ancient powers.	*Baptism by Fire* #1-6, *War of Heliopolis* #1-6, *Freedom Five* #540-542, *Ra: God of the Sun* #271-276, *Ra: Horus of Two Horizons* One-Shot	War of Heliopolis #6	Bastet's Regard	A normal cat, yes something ancient looks through its eyesâ€¦	Each Hero draws 4 cards.

The Curse of the Fey-Court	Jul 2002	Dark Watch (Vol. 1?) #37	The Heroes are welcomed into the Fey-Court, seemingly honored guests in this strange place. The grand revel begins, and all are invited to eat, drink, sing, and dance amongst the fey-courtiers! However, when the fey spirits wear off, something is amiss! The advisor who had helped the heroes is nowhere to be found, and the fey are all rather upset about what appears to be a mere misunderstanding...	1	The Fey-Court	Mercurial Court Proceedings	START PHASE Destroy the Advisor card with the highest HP. Discover 1 Advisor card. If no Advisor cards are destroyed or played, remove 1 token from each Villain character card and shuffle the Villain trash into the Villain deck.	When the court changed from the welcoming Summer Court to the frigid Winter Court, all of the members of the court changed as well, from the courtiers to the Dagda himself. What originally seemed a warm and welcoming place became cold and deadly. Only through the help of the leprechaun elder Ogma were the heroes able to get through to the rulers of the court and avoid the Morrigan's fury. Ultimately, the curse is lifted from Setback, and the rest of Dark Watch all paid their respects with intent to never return. All but one, that is. The Harpy had learned much from the Morrigan, and there was indication that this sharing of information -- and of power -- presented far more opportunities. What might the future hold here in the court of the fey?

Night's Plutonian Shore	Oct 1998	Night's Plutonian Shore One-Shot	The Matriarch's classic first appearance in the Silver Age of Sentinel Comics was reprised in the late '90s with the "Night's Plutonian Shore" One-Shot. In this telling of the story, the Matriarch posed a far greater threat, surrounded by scores of corvids and accompanied by two powerful avian cohorts. When the foul avian swarm descends upon Rook City, the heroes assemble to try to protect the citizens of the blighted boroughs. Ultimately, the story is a battle of science vs. magic, with the super-scientist Tachyon attempting to outwit the overwhelming power of her cousin the Matriarch!	2	The Matriarch	Pestilent Corvids	Whenever a Cohort card is destroyed, it deals the Hero target with the highest HP 3 toxic damage.	This retelling of the Matriarch's story also added another layer of nuance to the character. During this event, the readers and the heroes alike saw how overwhelmed Lillian Corvus was by the power of the Matriarch. As much as she was a dangerous villain fueled by fury, she was also a scared teenager who was being controlled by the mask as much as she was using its power. When the heroes defeated the Matriarch by subduing her cohorts, reaching the center of the avian maelstrom, and unmasking Lillian, she was captured and sent to prison. However, from this point forward, her cousin Dr. Meredith Stinson visited her often to talk about what happened.

Built in a Day	Jan 1990	Built in a Day #1	As the Chairman built his vast criminal enterprise, he stepped on many outstretched hands, kept a few allies close, betrayed the rest, and never looked back for even an instant. Now, the Organization is stronger than ever, but its sheer size and scope demand additional muscle in the ranks of leadership. The Chairman and his deadly right hand, the Operative, find their underbosses from many walks of life, but they all work toward the same goals: power, control, and profit.	1	The Organization	Retaliatory Patrolling	After a Villain target is destroyed, The Operative deals the Hero target with the highest HP 2 melee damage.	Many heroes attempted to stand in the way of the Organization. For all their successes, they seemed to make no real headway against the inevitable creeping corruption of this deeply rooted criminal enterprise. For every small-time thug they put behind bars, a suspiciously well-armed gang took to the streets. For every corrupt politician exposed, a wealthy campaign appeared, primed to put another patsy in their place. The Organization was always three steps ahead of any opposition, their influence running deep and their plans seemingly decades in the making. How could these criminals have such reach? Their influence is systemic, rotting the entire city from the inside out. The system is clearly broken, but is it beyond fixing?

Dread Will, Manifested	Nov 1987	NightMist #30	Deep within the burning expanse of Æternus, where rivers of fire cut through jagged wastelands and the air thickened with anguish, the throne of ultimate power stood empty. Forged from despair and veined with the essence of countless doomed souls, it was the focal point of infernal power. Without a ruler, chaos reigned. The demon princes, each embodying a cardinal sin, waged a gruesome struggle for the throne. Lusithar, Prince of Pride, demanded submission with silken words and blinding radiance. Abbados, Prince of Wrath, tore through legions in fiery rage. Seviathall, Prince of Envy, twisted ambitions from the shadows. Their battles tore at the very fabric of Æternus, ripping at the very seams of the realm. The rifts from their infighting widened, allowing whispers of torment to seep into the mortal plane. The living shuddered under the weight of these dark forces. The struggle for the throne threatened not just Æternus but all existence.	2	The Ruler of Æternus	Vox Populi	:ae: effects on non-Prince cards are active. END PHASE  Reveal the top ? minus 2 cards of the Villain deck. Play any non-Prince Demon cards revealed this way. Discard the other revealed cards.	As the demon princes' squabbles reached a fever pitch, Æternus spiraled into chaos. Rifts widened between Æternus and the mortal plane, spilling waves of torment into the living world. Each prince escalated their carnage, convinced the throne was within reach, while the dimension teetered on collapse. In the midst of the chaos, unlikely allies emerged. Mortal heroes, drawn into Æternus by the rifts, joined forces with rebellious demons seeking escape from torment. Together, they traversed nightmarish landscapes, dodging traps and battling grotesque abominations spawned by the princes' fury. At the Throne of Æternus, the allies exploited the princes' arrogance and greed, pitting them against one another and sealing the rifts, driving the princes back into their domain.  Æternus fell silent once more, its throne unclaimed but ominously awaiting the next cycle of ambition and betrayal. The mortal world is safe -- for now -- but the scars of this infernal war are etched across both realms, a chilling reminder of the horror that lingers just beyond the veil.	*NightMist* #30-31	NightMist #31	Rhyming Bargainer	Your heart's desire in a trice… if you pay my reasonable price.
